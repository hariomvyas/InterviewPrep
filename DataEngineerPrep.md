Things to Keep In Mind During SQL Interviews:

Beginner 
- Be able to explain the different types of joins. I have sometimes seen this question asked by recruiters as a screener question just to make sure they want to pass you along
- Know when HAVING is run in SQL's order of operations vs WHERE
- Know the difference between UNION and UNION ALL

Mid
- Understand how to use a CASE statement inside of a SUM or COUNT function
- Know at least 1-2 ways you could optimize a query and if you decide one of those answers will be put an index on the table..you should also know what the pros and cons of an index are
- Be able to implement both a subquery and CTE, but use a CTE if you want to prove that you have good SQL habits

Advanced
- Know how to answer a problem with and without a window function. Usually you will need to implement a self join in order to imitate some window functions such as LAG and LEAD.
- Understand and be able to explain what a correlated subquery is
- Just reference that you would look at the query execution plan. They will be shocked you even know what that is.
